## Key Learnings:
In this visualization, we could identify:
- Sales Trend: The line graph indicates that December had highest sales figures. This can be as a result of the December holiday and practice of exchanging gifts.
- Top selling products: We can identify which are the top 5 selling products by using a bar chart
- Also did some additional analysis to find out top 5 cities by sales using the map visual
